# Allow Swift types to provide custom Objective-C representations

* Proposal: SE-NNNN
* Author(s): [Russ Bishop](https://github.com/russbishop)
* Status: **Awaiting review**
* Review manager: TBD


# Introduction

Provide an `ObjectiveCBridgeable` protocol that allows a Swift type to control how it is represented in Objective-C by converting into and back from an entirely separate `@objc` type. This frees library authors to create truly native Swift APIs while still supporting Objective-C.

Swift-evolution thread: [[Idea] ObjectiveCBridgeable](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/7852/)


# Motivation

There is currently no good way to define a Swift-y API that makes use of generics, enums with associated values, structs, protocols with associated types, and other Swift features while still exposing that API to Objective-C.

This is especially prevelant in a mixed codebase. Often an API must be dumbed-down or Swift features eschewed because rewriting the entire codebase is impractical and Objective-C code must be able to call the new Swift code. This results in a situation where new code or refactored code adopts an Objective-C compatible API which is compromised, less type safe, and isn't as nice to work with as a truly native Swift API. 

The cascading effect is even worse because when the last vestiges of Objective-C have been swept away, you're left with a mountain of Swift code that essentially looks like a direct port of Objective-C code and doesn't take advantage of any of Swift's modern features. 

For framework and library authors it presents an awful choice:

1. Write mountains of glue code to convert between Swift and Objective-C versions of your types.
2. Write your shiny new framework in Swift, but in an Objective-C style using only `@objc` types.
3. Write your shiny new framework in Objective-C.

Choice #1 is not practical in the real world with ship dates, resulting in most teams choosing #2 or #3. 


# Proposed Solution

Today you can adopt the private protocol `_ObjectiveCBridgeable` and when a bridged collection (like `Array` &lt;--&gt; `NSArray`) is passed between Swift and Objective-C, Swift will automatically call the appropriate functions to  control the way the type bridges. This allows a Swift type to have a completely different representation in Objective-C.

The solution proposed is to expose a new protocol `ObjectiveCBridgeable` and have the compiler generate the appropriate Objective-C bridging thunks for any function or property of an `@objc` type, not just for values inside collections. The default implementation of `ObjectiveCBridgeable` will provide partial conformance to `_ObjectiveCBridgeable` so the existing functionality will work as expected for types adopting the new protocol.

**Note:** Expressing a more generalized mapping mechanism (eg: `NSInteger` to `Int`) is not currently within the scope of this proposal. Allowing Objective-C code to control its manifestation to a Swift consumer is also outside the scope of this proposal.

## ObjectiveCBridgeable Protocol

```
/// A type adopting `ObjectiveCBridgeable` will be exposed
/// to Objective-C as the type `ObjectiveCType`
public protocol ObjectiveCBridgeable: _ObjectiveCBridgeable {
    associatedtype ObjectiveCType : AnyObject
    associatedtype _ObjectiveCType = ObjectiveCType

    /// Returns `true` iff instances of `Self` can be converted to
    /// Objective-C.  Even if this method returns `true`, a given
    /// instance of `Self._ObjectiveCType` may, or may not, convert
    /// successfully to `Self`.
    ///
    /// A default implementation returns `true`.
    @warn_unused_result
    static func isBridgedToObjectiveC() -> Bool

    /// Convert `self` to Objective-C.
    @warn_unused_result
    func bridgeToObjectiveC() -> ObjectiveCType

    /// Try to construct a value of the Self type from
    /// an Objective-C object of the bridged class type.
    ///
    /// If the conversion fails this initializer returns `nil`.
    init?(bridgedFromObjectiveC: ObjectiveCType)
}

public extension ObjectiveCBridgeable {
    static func isBridgedToObjectiveC() -> Bool { return true }
}

/// Provides default partial conformance to the private
/// protocol _ObjectiveCBridgeable
public extension ObjectiveCBridgeable {
    static func _isBridgedToObjectiveC() -> Bool {
        return isBridgedToObjectiveC()
    }

    static func _getObjectiveCType() -> Any.Type {
        return ObjectiveCType.self
    }

    func _bridgeToObjectiveC() -> ObjectiveCType {
        return bridgeToObjectiveC()
    }

    static func _forceBridgeFromObjectiveC(
        source: ObjectiveCType,
        inout result: Self?
    ) {
        result = Self.init(bridgedFromObjectiveC: source)
        precondition(result != nil)
    }

    static func _conditionallyBridgeFromObjectiveC(
        source: ObjectiveCType,
        inout result: Self?
    ) -> Bool {
        result = Self.init(bridgedFromObjectiveC: source)
        return result != nil
    }
}
```

# Detailed Design

1. Expose the protocol `ObjectiveCBridgeable`
  1. Any type adopting `ObjectiveCBridgeable` will gain conformance to `_ObjectiveCBridgeable`
2. When generating an Objective-C interface for an `@objc` type:
  1. When a function contains parameters or return types that are `@nonobjc` but those types adopt `ObjectiveCBridgeable`:
     1. Create `@objc` thunks that call the Swift functions but substitute the corresponding `ObjectiveCType`.
     2. The thunks will call the appropriate protocol functions to perform the conversion.
  2. If any `@nonobjc` types do not adopt `ObjectiveCBridgeable`, the function itself is not exposed to Objective-C (current behavior).
3. Collection bridging works just as it does today since conforming types also adopt the existing private protocol.
4. The `ObjectiveCType` must be defined in Swift. If a `-swift.h` header is generated, it will include a `SWIFT_BRIDGED()` macro where the parameter indicates the Swift type with which the `ObjectiveCType` bridges. The macro will be applied to the `ObjectiveCType` and any subclasses.
5. It is an error for bridging to be ambiguous.
  1. A Swift type may bridge to an Objective-C base class, then provide different subclass instances at runtime but no other Swift type may bridge to that base class or any of its subclasses.
  2. The compiler must emit a diagnostic when it detects two Swift types attempting to bridge to the same `ObjectiveCType`. 
6. The Swift type and `ObjectiveCType` must be defined in the same module


## Example

Here is an enum with associated values that adopts the protocol and bridges by converting itself into an object representation.

*Note: The ways you can represent the type in Objective-C are endless; Iâ€™d prefer not to bikeshed that particular bit :) The Objective-C type is merely one representation you could choose to allow getting and setting the enum's associated values*

```
enum Fizzer {
    case Case1(String)
    case Case2(Int, Int)
}

extension Fizzer: ObjectiveCBridgeable {
    typealias ObjectiveCType = ObjCFizzer

    func bridgeToObjectiveC() -> ObjCFizzer {
        let bridge = ObjCFizzer()
        switch self {
        case let .Case1(x):
            bridge._case1 = x
        case let .Case2(x, y):
            bridge._case2 = (x, y)
        }
        return bridge
    }

    init?(bridgedFromObjectiveC source: ObjCFizzer) {
        if let stringValue = source._case1 {
            self = Fizzer.Case1(stringValue)
        } else if let tupleValue = source._case2 {
            self = Fizzer.Case2(tupleValue.0, tupleValue.1)
        } else {
            return nil
        }
    }
}

class ObjCFizzer: NSObject {
    private var _case1: String?
    private var _case2: (Int, Int)?

    var fizzyString: String? { return _case1 }
    var fizzyX: Int? { return _case2?.0 }
    var fizzyY: Int? { return _case2?.1 }

    func setTupleCase(x: Int, y: Int) {
        _case1 = nil
        _case2 = (x, y)
    }

    func setStringCase(string: String) {
        _case1 = string
        _case2 = nil
    }
}
```

# Impact on existing code

None. There are no breaking changes and adoption is opt-in.


# Alternatives considered

The main alternative, as stated above, is not to adopt Swift features that cannot be expressed in Objective-C. 

The less fesible alternative is to provide bridging manually by segmenting methods and properties into `@objc` and `@nonobjc` variants, then manually converting at all the touch points. In practice I don't expect this to be very common due to the painful overhead it imposes. Developers are much more likely to avoid using Swift features (even subconsciously).
