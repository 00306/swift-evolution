# Allow Swift types to provide custom Objective-C representations

* Proposal: SE-NNNN

# Introduction

Provide an `ObjectiveCBridgeable` protocol that allows a Swift type to control how it is represented in Objective-C by converting into and back from an entirely separate `@objc` type. This frees library authors to create truly native Swift APIs while still supporting Objective-C.

Swift-evolution thread: [[Idea] ObjectiveCBridgeable](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.swift.evolution/7852/)


# Motivation

There is currently no good way to define a Swift-y API that makes use of generics, enums with associated values, structs, protocols with associated types, and other Swift features while still exposing that API to Objective-C.

This is especially prevelant in a mixed codebase. Often an API must be dumbed-down or Swift features eschewed because rewriting the entire codebase is impractical and Objective-C code must be able to call the new Swift code. This results in a situation where new code or refactored code adopts an Objective-C compatible API which is compromised, less type safe, and isn't as nice to work with as a truly native Swift API. 

The cascading effect is even worse because when the last vestiges of Objective-C have been swept away, you're left with a mountain of Swift code that essentially looks like a direct port of Objective-C code and doesn't take advantage of any of Swift's modern features. 

For framework and library authors it presents an awful choice:

1. Write mountains of glue code to convert between Swift and Objective-C versions of your types.
2. Write your shiny new framework in Swift, but in an Objective-C style using only `@objc` types.
3. Write your shiny new framework in Objective-C.

Choice #1 is not practical in the real world with ship dates, resulting in most teams choosing #2 or #3. 


# Proposed Solution

Today you can adopt the private protocol `_ObjectiveCBridgeable` and when a bridged collection (like `Array` &lt;--&gt; `NSArray`) is passed between Swift and Objective-C, Swift will automatically call the appropriate functions to  control the way the type bridges. This allows a Swift type to have a completely different representation in Objective-C.

The solution proposed is to expose a new protocol `ObjectiveCBridgeable` and have the compiler generate the appropriate Objective-C bridging thunks for any function or property of an `@objc` type, not just for values inside collections. 


## ObjectiveCBridgeable Protocol

```
/// A type adopting `ObjectiveCBridgeable` will be exposed
/// to Objective-C as the type `ObjectiveCType`
public protocol ObjectiveCBridgeable {
    associatedtype ObjectiveCType : NSObject

    /// Returns `true` iff instances of `Self` can be converted to
    /// Objective-C.  Even if this method returns `true`, a given
    /// instance of `Self.ObjectiveCType` may, or may not, convert
    /// successfully to `Self`.
    ///
    /// A default implementation returns `true`. If a Swift type is 
    /// generic and should only be bridged for some type arguments,
    /// provide alternate implementations in extensions 
    /// and return `false` in those cases.
    ///
    ///     struct Foo<T>: ObjectiveCBridgeable { ... }
    ///     extension Foo where T: NonBridgedType {
    ///         static func isBridgedToObjectiveC() -> Bool { 
    ///             return false 
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    @warn_unused_result
    static func isBridgedToObjectiveC() -> Bool

    /// Convert `self` to an instance of 
    /// `ObjectiveCType` (or one of its subclasses)
    @warn_unused_result
    func bridgeToObjectiveC() -> ObjectiveCType

    /// Bridge from an Objective-C object of the bridged class type to a
    /// value of the Self type.
    ///
    /// This bridging operation is used for unconditional bridging when
    /// interoperating with Objective-C code, either in the body of an
    /// Objective-C thunk or when calling Objective-C code, and may
    /// defer complete checking until later. For example, when bridging
    /// from `NSArray` to `Array<Element>`, we can defer the checking
    /// for the individual elements of the array.
    ///
    /// - parameter source: The Objective-C object from which we are
    /// bridging. This optional value will only be `nil` in cases where
    /// an Objective-C method has returned a `nil` despite being marked
    /// as `_Nonnull`/`nonnull`. In most such cases, bridging will
    /// generally force the value immediately. However, this gives
    /// bridging the flexibility to substitute a default value to cope
    /// with historical decisions, e.g., an existing Objective-C method
    /// that returns `nil` to for "empty result" rather than (say) an
    /// empty array. In such cases, when `nil` does occur, the
    /// implementation of `Swift.Array`'s conformance to
    /// `ObjectiveCBridgeable` will produce an empty array rather than
    /// dynamically failing.
    ///
    /// A default implementation calls `init(unconditionallyBridgedFromObjectiveC:)`
    static func unconditionallyBridgeFromObjectiveC(source: ObjectiveCType?)
        -> Self

    /// Attempt to construct a value of the `Self` type from
    /// an Objective-C object of the bridged class type
    ///
    /// If the conversion fails this initializer returns `nil`.
    init?(bridgedFromObjectiveC: ObjectiveCType)

    /// Unconditionally construct a value of the `Self` type
    /// from an Objective-C object of the bridged class type.
    ///
    /// A default implementation calls `init?(bridgedFromObjectiveC:)`
    /// and aborts if the conversion fails.
    init(unconditionallyBridgedFromObjectiveC: ObjectiveCType?)
}

public extension ObjectiveCBridgeable {
    static func isBridgedToObjectiveC() -> Bool { return true }
    static func unconditionallyBridgeFromObjectiveC(source: ObjectiveCType?) -> Self {
        return Self.init(unconditionallyBridgedFromObjectiveC: source)
    }
    init(unconditionallyBridgedFromObjectiveC source: ObjectiveCType?) {
        self.init(bridgedFromObjectiveC: source!)!
    }
}
```

# Detailed Design

1. Expose the protocol `ObjectiveCBridgeable`. This protocol will replace the old private protocol `_ObjectiveCBridgeable`.
2. When generating an Objective-C interface for an `@objc` class type:
  1. When a function contains parameters or return types that are `@nonobjc` but those types adopt `ObjectiveCBridgeable`:
     1. Create `@objc` thunks that call the Swift functions but substitute the corresponding `ObjectiveCType`.
     2. The thunks will call the appropriate protocol functions to perform the conversion.
  2. If any `@nonobjc` types do not adopt `ObjectiveCBridgeable`, the function itself is not exposed to Objective-C (current behavior).
3. Swift Standard library types like `String`, `Array`, `Dictionary`, and `Set` will adopt the new protocol, thus demoting their bridging behavior from *magic* to regular behavior.
4. A clang attribute will be provided to indicate which Swift type bridges to an Objective-C class. A convenience `SWIFT_BRIDGED()` macro will be provided.
  1. If the `ObjectiveCType` is defined in Objective-C, the programmer must annotate the `@interface` declaration with `SWIFT_BRIDGED("SwiftTypeName")`.
  2. If the `ObjectiveCType` is defined in Swift, it must be an `@objc` class type. The compiler will annotate the generated bridging header with `SWIFT_BRIDGED()` automatically.
5. It is an error for bridging to be ambiguous.
  1. A Swift type may bridge to an Objective-C base class, then provide different subclass instances at runtime but no other Swift type may bridge to that base class or any of its subclasses.
  2. The compiler must emit a diagnostic when it detects two Swift types attempting to bridge to the same `ObjectiveCType`.
6. The Swift type and `ObjectiveCType` must be defined in the same module. If the `ObjectiveCType` is defined in Objective-C then it must come from the same-named Objective-C module.


## Example

Here is an enum with associated values that adopts the protocol and bridges by converting itself into an object representation.

*Note: The ways you can represent the type in Objective-C are endless; Iâ€™d prefer not to bikeshed that particular bit :) The Objective-C type is merely one representation you could choose to allow getting and setting the enum's associated values*

```
enum Fizzer {
    case Case1(String)
    case Case2(Int, Int)
}

extension Fizzer: ObjectiveCBridgeable {
    typealias ObjectiveCType = ObjCFizzer

    func bridgeToObjectiveC() -> ObjCFizzer {
        let bridge = ObjCFizzer()
        switch self {
        case let .Case1(x):
            bridge._case1 = x
        case let .Case2(x, y):
            bridge._case2 = (x, y)
        }
        return bridge
    }

    init?(bridgedFromObjectiveC source: ObjCFizzer) {
        if let stringValue = source._case1 {
            self = Fizzer.Case1(stringValue)
        } else if let tupleValue = source._case2 {
            self = Fizzer.Case2(tupleValue.0, tupleValue.1)
        } else {
            return nil
        }
    }
}

class ObjCFizzer: NSObject {
    private var _case1: String?
    private var _case2: (Int, Int)?

    var fizzyString: String? { return _case1 }
    var fizzyX: Int? { return _case2?.0 }
    var fizzyY: Int? { return _case2?.1 }

    func setTupleCase(x: Int, y: Int) {
        _case1 = nil
        _case2 = (x, y)
    }

    func setStringCase(string: String) {
        _case1 = string
        _case2 = nil
    }
}
```

# Impact on existing code

None. There are no breaking changes and adoption is opt-in.


# Alternatives considered

The main alternative, as stated above, is not to adopt Swift features that cannot be expressed in Objective-C. 

The less feasible alternative is to provide bridging manually by segmenting methods and properties into `@objc` and `@nonobjc` variants, then manually converting at all the touch points. In practice I don't expect this to be very common due to the painful overhead it imposes. Developers are much more likely to avoid using Swift features (even subconsciously).


# Future Directions

## Conditional Conformance

It is intended that when and if Swift 3 adopts conditional protocol conformance that the standard library types such as `Array` and `Dictionary` will declare conditional conformance to `ObjectiveCBridgeable` if their element types are `ObjectiveCBridgeable` (with explicitly declared conformance for built-ins like `Int`).
