# Generalize function conversion for key path literals

* Proposal: [SE-NNNN](NNNN-generalize-keypath-function-conversions.md)
* Authors: [Frederick Kellison-Linn](https://github.com/jumhyn)
* Review Manager: TBD
* Status: **Awaiting review**
* Implementation: [apple/swift#39612](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/39612)

## Introduction

Allow key path literals to partake in the full generality of function-function conversions, so that the following code compiles without error:

```swift
let _: (String) -> Int? = \.count
```

## Motivation

[SE-0249](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0249-key-path-literal-function-expressions.md) introduced a conversion between key path literals and function types, which allowed users to write code like the following:

```swift
let strings = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
let counts = strings.map(\.count) // [5, 5, 1]
```

However, SE-0249 does not quite live up to its promise of allowing the equivalent key path construction "wherever it allows (Root) -> Value functions." Function types permit conversions that are covariant in the result type and contravariant in the parameter types, but key path literals require exact type matches. This can lead to some potentially confusing behavior from the compiler:

```swift
struct S {
  var x: Int
}

// All of the following are okay...
let f1: (S) -> Int = \.x
let f2: (S) -> Int? = f1
let f3: (S) -> Int? = { $0.x }
let f4: (S) -> Int? = { kp in { root in root[keyPath: kp] } }(\S.x)
let f5: (S) -> Int? = \.x as (S) -> Int

// But the direct conversion fails!
let f6: (S) -> Int? = \.x // <------------------- Error!
```

## Proposed solution

Allow key path literals to be converted freely in the same manner as functions are converted today. This would allow the definition `f6` above to compile without error, in addition to allowing constructions like:

```swift
class Base {
  var derived: Derived { Derived() }
}
class Derived: Base {}

let g1: (Derived) -> Base = \Base.derived
```

## Detailed design

Rather than permitting a key path literal with root type `Root` and value type `Value` to only be converted to a function type `(Root) -> Value`, key path literals will be permitted to be converted to any function type which `(Root) -> Value` may be converted to.

The actual key-path-to-function conversion transformation proceeds exactly as before, generating code with the following semantics (adapting an example from SE-0249):

```swift
// You write this:
let f: (User) -> String? = \User.email

// The compiler generates something like this:
let f: (User) -> String? = { kp in { root in root[keyPath: kp] } }(\User.email)
```

## Source compatibility

While this proposal _mostly_ only makes previously invalid code valid, [@jrose](https://forums.swift.org/u/jrose) pointed out a case where this proposal could potentially change the meaning of existing code:

```
func evil<T, U>(_: (T) -> U) { print("generic") }
func evil(_ x: (String) -> Bool?) { print("concrete") }

evil(\String.isEmpty)
```

Previously, the `evil` call would select the first overload of `evil` (printing "generic", since the `KeyPath<String, Bool>` to `(String) -> Bool?` conversion was considered invalid), but this proposal would select the second overload of `evil` (printing "concrete").

This proposal opts to treat such differences as a bug in the implementation of SE-0249, which promises that the keypath-to-function conversion will have "semantics equivalent to capturing the key path and applying it to the Root argument":

```swift
evil({ kp in { $0[keyPath: kp] } }(\String.isEmpty)) // Prints 'concrete'
```

The circumstances necessary are exceedingly narrow to reproduce the above behavior. It is not enough merely to declare the `evil` overloads. The following naive reproduction attempt fails to compile, thus posing no source compatibility error:

```
struct S {
    let x: Bool
}

func evil<T, U>(_: (T) -> U) {  }
func evil(_: (S) -> Bool?) {  }
evil(\S.x) // 
```

That this compilation fails seems to be a bug of its own. The additional ingredient appears to be overloading `x`â€”with the following additions, the snipped above compiles without error:

```
protocol P {}
extension P {
    var x: Bool { true }
}
extension S: P {}
```

So, to summarize, in order to cause a source compatibility issue, one must have:
1. Function overloads A and B accepting function arguments
2. A call to the overloaded function name, passed a keypath literal using an overloaded property
3. The keypath is viable for conversion to exactly one of A or B's parameter types under currently-implemented rules, but viable for conversion to _both_ A and B's parameter types under the rules in this proposal
4. The overload which is *not* currently viable would outrank the currently-viable overload once both are made viable under this proposal
5. A and B are not semantically interchangable such that calling one instead of the other results in a substantive change in behavior

In the author's judgement, the liklihood of any significant compatibility issue is negligible.
